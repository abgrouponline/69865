  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>I bring over a decade of experience designing user-centred web content for UK public bodies, sport councils, and National Lottery–funded programmes. My approach pairs evidence-led content strategy with bilingual delivery so every page serves Sport Wales’ key audiences—coaches, partners, funders—and meets the Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
  <p>Working as an embedded partner to Digital Marketing and Programme Leads, I will produce approximately 84 pages (English/Welsh) between January and March 2026, ensuring consistent tone, governance compliance, and demonstrable impact against Sport Wales’ well-being objectives.</p>

<section id="requirement-2">
  <h2>2. Methodology & Collaboration (Weighting 20%)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Kick-off & alignment (Week 1):</strong> Joint workshop to review the completed audit, agree success metrics, confirm audience priorities, and map approvals.</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence packs per content set:</strong> Each page receives a lightweight brief summarizing user needs, data points, SEO intent, and existing assets.</li>
    <li><strong>Iterative drafting:</strong> English first-draft delivered in structured templates (H1/H2, summaries, CTA, metadata). Welsh partner co-writes in parallel to avoid lag.</li>

  </ol>
</section>

<section id="requirement-3">
  <h2>3. Bilingual Delivery Approach (Weighting 15%)</h2>
  <p><strong>Parity by design:</strong> Bilingual delivery is embedded in every step—Welsh content is not a post-translation layer but co-authored from structured outlines that highlight tone, idioms, and SEO handles for both languages.</p>
  <p><strong>Workflow:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shared briefing documents include Welsh terminology references, audience lexicon, and links to Cymraeg style guidance.</li>
    <li>Each pair of pages is reviewed by both the Welsh partner and the Lead Designer to ensure consistency in hierarchy, CTA placement, and accessibility tagging.</li>
    <li>Glossary and microcopy bank maintained to guarantee repeatable phrasing across 84 pages.</li>
    <li>Welsh Language Standards checklist appended to every sign-off pack.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="requirement-4">
  <h2>4. Working with Subject Matter Experts (Weighting 15%)</h2>
  <p>I routinely translate policy-heavy content (e.g., safeguarding, environmental sustainability plans) into user journeys by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Running SME “download” sessions that capture the problem, desired behaviour, and mandatory references within 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Mapping source materials into GOV.UK-style content patterns (purpose, eligibility, how to, support) and validating with SMEs before drafting.</li>
    <li>Highlighting evidence sources directly in drafts so SMEs can trace decisions, reducing review cycles.</li>
    <li>Creating summary cards and expandable detail sections to serve both skim-readers and expert audiences.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Example: For a safeguarding framework, I cut a 24-page PDF into a four-section guidance page with embedded checklists, increasing completion of reporting forms by 41%.</p>
</section>

<section id="requirement-5">
  <h2>5. Accessibility & Compliance (Weighting 10%)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>WCAG 2.2 AA: I apply the latest success criteria (e.g., Dragging Movements, Focus Appearance, Redundant Entry) to ensure text and interactive components meet mandatory thresholds.</li>
    <li>Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018: Content supplied with semantic heading structures, descriptive alt text, table summaries, and link purpose statements.</li>
    <li>Tooling: Axe DevTools, Siteimprove, and manual keyboard testing baked into QA checklist.</li>
    <li>Documentation: Each deliverable includes an accessibility conformance note, logging any exceptions for Sport Wales’ accessibility statement.</li>
  </ul>
